# SN3193 Driver for Rust
<!-- cargo-sync-readme start -->

This Rust `embedded-hal`-based library is a simple way to control the SN3193 RGB LED driver.
The SN3193 is a 3-channel LED driver with PWM control and breathing mode. It can drive up to
3 LEDs with a maximum current of 42 mA and is controlled via I2C. This driver is designed for the
`no_std` environment, so it can be used in embedded systems.
